## Climate Data Analysis / Extracting Weather Patterns from Climate Data

This project involved clustering a preprocessed climate dataset using distance and density based unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The dataset was extensively preprocessed to enhance its quality, including feature selection, data cleaning, and standardization. The study compared the performance of distance-based clustering methods against the density-based. Our results indicated that the distance-based methods performed better in clustering and interpretation, and meaningful weather conditions were extracted such as 'Hot and Sunny' and 'Cold and Rainy'. A more complex pattern of 'Stormy Weather' was determined as well through adjustments.
