### Creation of a Custom Decision Tree comparative to SKlearn Implementation

This work delves into the creation and comprehensive evaluation of a custom decision tree classifier, contrasting its outcomes with the widely-used SKlearn library implementation. Through extensive testing across diverse datasets with varied parameters, this work (i) assess the performance of a custom implementation of a decision tree classifier, with the SKlearn implementation, (ii) evaluates result metrics encompassing accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Mathewâ€™s correlation, and prediction similarity, and computational metrics including training time and memory utilization.

Comparative analysis revealed marginal differences, approximately within a 1% range, between the out- comes of the custom and SKlearn classifiers. Notably, prediction similarity stands at around 98%, indicating closely aligned performances. A detailed exploration of the impact of input parameters reveals that sample size, depth and minimum samples criteria have some impact on evaluation metrics, but a greater impact on training time and memory utilization. The robustness of findings is supported by statistical analyses throughout the study, informing the significance of observed changes. Lastly, this study brings focus to optimal configurations for custom classifiers, highlighting the delicate balance between capturing dataset nuances and preventing over fitting.
